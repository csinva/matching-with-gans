# matching + benchmarking

This folder contains code for matching using GAN latent space and then subsequently benchmarking facial recognition systems. This section does not require `StyleGAN2` dependencies, instead requiring the precomputed distances between images in GAN space.

The `eda` notebooks give exploratory analysis into different dataset and aspects of the matching. The non-eda notebooks are used to reproduce the results in the paper.
